5 reasons why Java is still the best programming language
1. Java is easy to learn
Each programming language accompanies an expectation to learn and adapt, yet Java imparts numerous similitudes to C, C++, and JavaScript. Anybody with experience in any of those dialects will get Java sentence structure rapidly.
Java likewise has an exceptionally unbending and unsurprising arrangement of decisions that oversee code structure. These differences obviously with other, untyped prearranging dialects where it seems like anything goes. At the point when you attempt to dominate another programming language, an unmistakable arrangement of reliably upheld rules makes learning more straightforward.
Besides, when things don't seem OK, developers new to Java can find major areas of strength for an organization of YouTube recordings, sites like StackOverflow, and online discussions like CodeRanch to track down replies to a large number of inquiries.

2.The rich set of Java APIs

The Java Programming interface is broad. The standard JDK accompanies more than 200 inherent bundles containing Java APIs that take into consideration all that from parsing XML to interpreting between time regions. At the point when engineers add on the Jakarta EE APIs, they have a much greater library of APIs that take into account the improvement of intricate, center-level applications and cloud-local microservices.
However, the rich biological system of Java APIs reaches a long way past those endorsed by Prophet or provisioned through Jakarta.
For information determination, there's the JBoss Sleep project. For cloud-local microservices improvement in Java, there's the full set-up of Spring Boot APIs. Furthermore, there's a large number of open-source Apache Programming interface projects that address an extensive variety of programming improvement use cases, from conglomerating blunder messages with log4j to tackling muddled issues with HashMaps and safeguard Iterators through the Apache House Assortments Programming interface.
The rich arrangement of Java APIs accessible to designers helps in the advancement of solid, blunder-free applications.

3. Java's tool ecosystem
The application improvement scene is loaded up with programming advancement apparatuses written in Java - - by Java engineers - - that are intended to rearrange and smooth out the turn of events, arrangement, and in any event, decommissioning of Java applications. A couple of instances of devices written in Java include:
Gradle: an inconceivably strong, open-source construct device
Expert: an open-source instrument intended to take care of reliance on the executive's issues
Jenkins: a Java-based persistent combination and conveyance device
This is in no way, shape or form a comprehensive rundown of Java's apparatus biological system. Different instances of devices and advances written in Java incorporate application servers like Tomcat to Red Cap's famous, Kubernetes-local Java stack named Quarkus

4. First-order Android Support
Android is the world's most famous cell phone operating system and Java is the accepted programming language for Android application advancement.
While Android's variant of Java isn't the very same as what you'd find on the JDK, Google replicated more than 11,500 lines of code from the Java Standard Version when they constructed their Java clone. Accordingly, engineers can expect that the rendition of Java they see on Android is very near the first.
Assuming you know can compose Java code for work areas or server-side applications, you'll get Android advancement rapidly. The low-level contrasts between the JVM and the Dalvik Android Runtime will be in every way charmingly disconnected away from you after a concise expectation to learn and adapt. At the point when designers learn Java, the whole Android biological system will be available to them.

5. Forward evolution with backwards compatibility
Java advances gradually, yet it develops. With north of 25 years of development, Java has a lot of transformative upgrades to be pleased about.
From the impenetrable seclusion framework that was conveyed as a component of Undertaking Jigsaw, to the as-of-late added capacity of Java Classes in Pune with Sevenmentor, Java keeps on executing enormous changes that the local area requests.

Gradual augmentations in non-LTS discharges, for example, the expansion of the new Record information type and trash specialists for further developed memory of the executives, exhibit that the JDK is likewise continually advancing.
However, in the undertaking programming improvement world, reverse similarity is similarly just about as significant as adding new highlights. Java has consistently focused on this for the stewards of the language. Seldom does an exhaustive update or element expansion make issues with code composed against more seasoned discharges.
I for one assembled and bundled some muddled code that was composed a long time back, and it ran with no issues on the most recent Java 17 delivery. At the point when venture clients realize that things won't break when they play out a JVM update, it gives simply one more justification for why they decide to stay with Java as the best programming language.
